# my-chess
A chess program and graphical user interface created with Python.

## Summary
I started *MyChess* as a throwaway project to gain a better understanding of chess theory in general. 
The program expanded the more I learned about the game, and so more features were added along the way.
A major component of the program is to oversee the players' moves and ensure they conform to the standard rules. The chess engine moderates
the game in the background while displaying a user-friendly graphical interface (PyGame and TkInter).


*MyChess* is currently software version is 0.7-beta. The game is playable, however there are bugs and issues, and there are
missing features such as castling, en passant, promotion, and stalemate to name a few. On that note I'd recommend Stockfish or Komodo ;)
